NOT THAT IMPORTANT FOR NOW:
closures
concurrency -- event loop, what's the main thread doing when it commissions a JFrame on an EDT?

DONE:
do jframes run on their own separate threads?
how to make window modal?
how to close only the form on the application and then launch another form / window / frame if the ok button was clicked but exit the application if the close button was clicked.
